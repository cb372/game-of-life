# Conway's Game of Life

I built this in order to teach myself PureScript.

It's dog slow, probably because it uses a Seq to represent the board and it repaints the whole canvas every time.

## How to build

pulp build -O --to output.js

## How to run the tests

lolz

## Further work

Could add a building step whereby the user clicks on cells to mark them as alive, then clicks a button to start the game. Would be fun to try building this with React.

Could also make it faster pretty easily.

Write some damn tests.
